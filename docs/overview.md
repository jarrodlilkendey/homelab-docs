# My Homelab Overview

My homelab server is a Lenovo laptop running Ubuntu Server on the bare metal. It has internet connectivity via WiFi and has an external USB harddrive for additional storage primarily for the media server.

Installed on the host Ubuntu Server is Proxmox and all of the applications I run within the home server run inside of Ubuntu Server Virtual Machines that run within Proxmox.

Generally these applications are Dockerised but not always.

Proxmox is accessible on my home network via: https://10.0.0.12:8006/
